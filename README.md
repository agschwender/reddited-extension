Reddited
=========

Check if the page you are viewing has been submitted to Reddit. While there are comparable extensions, the reddited extension is less obtrusive. It will only send the url of page you are viewing to reddit when explicitly told to. It relies on chrome's popup layer rather than manipulating the current page.
