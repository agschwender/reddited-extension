Reddited Browser Extension
==========================

The Reddited Browser Extension allows you to check if the page you are viewing has been submitted to Reddit. It works on all URLs: web pages, videos, images, etc... So now you can finally get the inscrutable imgur jokes your friends send you. It allows you to quickly up or down vote the page or go directly to the page's comments without having to search on Reddit. And if the page you are viewing hasn't been submitted to Reddit, the extension provides a convenient link for submitting the page yourself.  

While there are comparable extensions, the reddited extension was designed to be is less obtrusive. It will only send the page you are viewing to reddit when explicitly told to do so, maintaining your privacy. It relies on chrome's popup layer rather than manipulating the page itself, maintaining the page's original content.
