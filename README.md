Reddited Browser Extension
==========================

The Reddited extension allows you to check if the page you are viewing has been submitted to Reddit. It works on all URLs: web pages, videos, images, etc... So now you can finally get the inscrutable imgur jokes your friends send you. It allows you to quickly up or down vote the page or go directly to the page's comments without having to search on Reddit. And if the page you are viewing hasn't been submitted to Reddit, the extension provides a convenient link for submitting the page yourself.

By default, the extension will automatically check if the page you are viewing has been submitted to Reddit for a small set of common domains. This can be expanded to all domains, no domains or a specific set of your choosing through the options page. This allows full control over which pages are sent to Reddit and protects your privacy. If automatic checking is enabled, the Reddited extension button will indicate the number of times the page has been submitted to Reddit.

While there are comparable extensions, the Reddited extension was designed to be less obtrusive. It will only send those pages you are viewing to Reddit when they reside on domains that you are comfortable sending or when you explicitly click the extension button, maintaining your privacy. It relies on chrome's popup layer rather than manipulating the page itself, maintaining the page's original content. It will prefer the canonical URL over the tab URL, avoiding missing content for sites which add arbitrary query parameters (I'm looking at you New York Times). It also uses reddit's exact layout giving it a familiar user interface.

### INSTRUCTIONS

Click the Reddited extension button on any page and the extension will search for that URL on Reddit. If it finds submissions, it will list the 5 most relevant submissions. If it does not find submissions, it will provide you with a post link.
